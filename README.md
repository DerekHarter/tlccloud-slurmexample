# Slurm Examples for TAMUC Lion Cloud (TLC)

The purpose of this repository is to collect examples of how to run slurm jobs on the
TAMUC Lion Cluster (TLC) slurm batching system.  Students, faculty and visiting researchers
are welcome to use the examples from this repository to get started setting up their work.
